# XSS Vulnerability Demo

A comprehensive educational demonstration of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and prevention techniques.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open the demo**: Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
2. **Test the demo**: Enter text in the input fields and see the difference between vulnerable and secure implementations
3. **Try XSS payloads**: Use the quick demo buttons or enter your own XSS payloads

## 🎯 Features

### Interactive Demo
- **Vulnerable Implementation**: Shows how user input can be directly rendered (dangerous)
- **Secure Implementation**: Demonstrates proper input sanitization and encoding
- **Real-time Detection**: XSS patterns are detected as you type
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded alerts and animations

### Educational Elements
- **Quick Demo Payloads**: Pre-built XSS examples to test
- **Prevention Techniques**: List of security best practices
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+Enter`: Run automatic demo
  - `Esc`: Clear all inputs

### Modern UI
- **Cybersecurity Theme**: Dark theme with neon accents
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Smooth Animations**: Professional visual effects
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual indicators and feedback

## 🛡️ Security Features Demonstrated

### Vulnerable Implementation
- Direct HTML insertion without sanitization
- Allows script execution
- Demonstrates real XSS risks

### Secure Implementation
- HTML entity encoding
- Pattern-based filtering
- Input validation
- Safe output rendering

## 🧪 Testing XSS Payloads

Try these examples in the input fields:

```html
<script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
javascript:alert("XSS")
<iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS')"></iframe>
```
